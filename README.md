# WikiBOT
My personal twin. He helps out on: https://discord.gg/DjV37ed

This bot can't be added to a Discord server, but you can self-host it. I'm not going to show you how, but you can look it up. Also, it might not work with your server, since my values aren't changeable and you would need a little bit of JavaScript knowledge to be able to know how to change them :|

Also, don't be a scumbag and change everything to your name and say you made it. Rethink your life if you're this person...
