# WikiBOT
My personal twin. He helps out on: https://discord.gg/DjV37ed

This bot can't be added to a Discord server, but you can self-host it. I'm not going to show you how, but you can look it up. Google is very helpful ;)

Also, don't be a scumbag and change everything to your name and say you made it. Rethink your life if you're this person...
